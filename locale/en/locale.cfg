[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
introduction=In the Demolision Derby there are effects that can give you advantage (or disadvantage) in the arena. They are applied by driving through the effect. The background colour of these effects determines who the effect is applied to. A green effect is applied to you, a red one to a random enemy, and a blue one to all players. This is true regardless of if the effect is good or bad.
