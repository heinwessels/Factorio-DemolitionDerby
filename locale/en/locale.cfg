what-is-demolition-derby=Demolition Derby is multiplayer minigame where you are driving a vehicle while contained in a small arena with other players, and the last player alive wins. You die by crashing, or being killed by one of the various effects. Your vehicle also leaves behind a trail of walls which becomes obstacles to dodge or trap your enemies with.\n\n[font=heading-2]How To Play:[/font]\n    1. Enter a Lobby with you friends by standing on one of the coloured teleporting pads.\n    2. When you and your friend are ready enter one of the vehicles. \n    3. Once all players entered a vehicle you'll be teleported to the arena, where the round will start.\n    4. Last player alive wins!\n\n[font=heading-2]General Info:[/font]\n    - Your score increases for each player that dies while you're alive.\n    - Your score is kept as long as you are in the lobby.\n    - See the other tips-and-tricks to read more about the various effects.\n    - It's more fun if you try to trap your enemies with your trail!
