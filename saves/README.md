## Map Data Files

Map data lua tables should be in here, and my save file. It will (hopefully) be expanded on how to set it up, but here is a few notes so long.

- Is there a reason borders need to be neutral?
- Arena Radars should be neutral. Player should see radar coverage, but worm may not attack it.
- The forces must be setup so that Neutral shares radar with Player force.

TODO This isn't working though.
